    <p>The type attribute in the <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> tag specifies the type of input control to display. Each input type serves a different purpose and can collect different kinds of data. Here's an explanation of the different type attribute values used inside the <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> tag:</p>

    <h3>Text (<code>type="text"</code>):</h3>

    <h3>Password (<code>type="password"</code>):</h3>

    <h3>Email (<code>type="email"</code>):</h3>
    <p>Validates that the input follows the email format (contains "@" and a valid domain name). Useful for collecting email addresses and ensuring they are entered correctly.</p>

    <h3>Number (<code>type="number"</code>):</h3>
    <p>Allows input of a numerical value. Can include additional attributes like min, max, and step to specify constraints and increment/decrement behavior.</p>

    <h3>Checkbox (<code>type="checkbox"</code>):</h3>

    <h3>Hidden (<code>type="hidden"</code>):</h3>
